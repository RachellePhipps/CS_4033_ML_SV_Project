KNN

----

So far I have done KNN regression with all the possible samples

However the results aren't exactly great and the MSE are about 0.38 or below to 0.28 


So what am I going to do now? 

First, I actually want to try to use sckilearn just to get it going. The results might not be great
like my own lol but it'll give a little basis maybe
